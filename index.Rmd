# Does the energy saving light bulb really last 10,000 hours?

```{r box image, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="10,000 hour claim on the original package", out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/pablo/Documents/Code/R/DatesTime_playground/images/10000Claim.jpeg")
```

```{r data input, include=FALSE}
date_installed <- as.Date("April-28-2018", format("%B-%d-%Y"))
date_failed <- as.Date("October-20-2020", format("%B-%d-%Y"))
duration <- diff.Date(x = c(date_installed, date_failed))
print(paste0("Time installed: ", duration, " days.") )
```

The first light bulb with an installed date failed today, `r format(date_failed, "%B-%d-%Y")`. It was a Phillips Mini-Twister model, containing mercury. It was installed on `r format(date_installed, "%B-%d-%Y")`.  

```{r first light bulb, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="First light bulb that needed replacement with an installation date", out.width='20%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/pablo/Documents/Code/R/DatesTime_playground/images/LightBulb.jpeg")
```

The installed time is `r duration` days.
Let's turn this into an estimate of hours of use and compare it to the expected number of hours of service accouding to the manufacturer.

The question we are trying to answer is how many hours per day would this light bulb have to have been in service to meet the 10,000 hour specification. Let's try to answer it with a plot.


```{r estimate hours of service, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
hours_day <- seq(from = 0.25, to = 14, by = 0.05)
hours_service <- rep(duration, times = length(hours_day)) * hours_day
data <- data.frame(x = hours_day, y = hours_service)
hot_point <- 11.0
ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  theme(plot.margin = unit(c(1, 2, 1, 1), "lines")) +
  geom_line() +
  annotate("text", x = hot_point + 2.0, y = 500,
           label = paste0(hot_point, "hours/day"),
           colour = "#EC7014",
           size = 6) +
  geom_segment(x = 0, y = 10000,
               xend = hot_point, yend = 10000,
               lineend = "round",
               linejoin = "round",
               size = 0.75,
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm")),
               colour = "#EC7014") +
  geom_segment(x = hot_point, y = 10000,
               xend = hot_point, yend = 0,
               lineend = "round",
               linejoin = "round",
               size = 0.75,
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm")),
               colour = "#EC7014") 
# geom_text(x = hot_point + 0.5, 
  #           y = 0,
  #           label = hot_point)
```

The straight  line was created using the observed duration multiplied by the _x_ axis, hours/day. Clearly the manufacturer's stated durability of  10,000 hours of service at 3 to 4 hours per day did not apply in this case. 

The plot indicates that for this light bulb to have been in service that many hours it would have had to be in service about 11 hours/day. That is far from being the use pattern we have given this light bulb. We estimate that the light bulb had some 2,500 hours of service at most in the 906 days it was installed, and that accounts for the effect of family members starting to work from home after the COVID-19 pandemic. That increased the use from 3h/day to about 10h/day only in the last 4 months since an office was moved to the basement.
